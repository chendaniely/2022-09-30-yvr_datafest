Intro to Python

## Installation

1. See the Software-Carpentry Installations for `python`:   https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#python
    - This is the single most important part, the rest of the steps below is less essential as long as you have python installed before the workshop.

### Testing your installation

1. Run the `test_installation.py` script (or copy/paste the import statments into a python interpreter)

```python
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import sklearn as sk
```

### How to run the Jupyter Notebook

#### Windows/Mac

There will be an [Anaconda Navigator](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/navigator/) application that installs to your system.
You can launch the Jupyter notebook from there to run your python code.

#### Linux

Anaconda's Python installation should be your system's default python.
Make sure you open a new terminal window for this to take effect.
You can launch python by typing `jupyter notebook`

## Creating a Notebook

Once you have the Jupyter notebook launched, there's a button towards the top right called `new`.
Click this and select `Python 3`.
